 # Network-Log-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Apache-Spark
 Network log analysis involves collecting, storing, and analyzing network traffic data to detect anomalies, security threats, and performance issues. 
Logs are generated by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), routers, and network monitoring tools. 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights for cybersecurity, compliance, and network performance monitoring.
With the increasing volume of network traffic, big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark are used to efficiently process and analyze large-scale logs.
Efficient analysis of network logs to detect anomalies and security threats.
Visualization of log data using graphs, dashboards, and statistical plots for better insights.
Processing large-scale network logs with Apache Spark for scalable and fast analysis.
Identifying patterns in network traffic to detect attacks like DDoS, port scanning, and unauthorized access.
